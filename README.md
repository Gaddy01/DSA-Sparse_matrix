# DSA-Sparse_matrix Assignment

This project is a Data Structures and Algorithms assignment focusing on operations with sparse matrices.  
A sparse matrix is a matrix predominantly filled with zero values, and this project provides tools to efficiently store and manipulate such matrices.

## Features

- **Efficient Storage**: Utilizes data structures that store only non-zero elements to save memory.
- **Matrix Operations**: Supports operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication of sparse matrices.
- **Data Handling**: Includes functionality to read input data and write output results.

## Repository Structure
```bash
DSA-Sparse_matrix/
├── input_data/ # Contains input files for matrix operations
├── output_data/ # Stores the results of matrix operations
├── sparseMatricesOperations.py # Main script with implementations of sparse matrix operations
└── README.md # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gaddy01/DSA-Sparse_matrix.git
   cd DSA-Sparse_matrix
   ```

2. **Prepare Input Data**:
Place your input matrix files in the input_data/ directory. Ensure they are formatted correctly as per the project's requirements.

3. **Run the Script**:
Execute the main script to perform matrix operations:
```bash
python sparseMatricesOperations.py
```

4. **View Results**:
The results will be saved in the output_data/ directory.

## usage

The sparseMatricesOperations.py script reads matrices from the input_data/ directory, performs specified operations, and writes the results to the output_data/ directory.
Ensure that your input files are named and formatted correctly. You may need to modify the script to match your specific input file names and desired operations.

## ⚠️ Attention
N.B: I did not upload the multiplication result file because it was too large (500MB). Please if you're running the multiplication operation, be patient, it might take a while.
